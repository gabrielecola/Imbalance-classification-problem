\section{The classification problem}

Classification is a technique where we categorize data into a given number of classes. The main goal of a classification problem is to identify the category/class to which a new data will fall under.\noindent \\
Classification problems can be divided in: \noindent \\
1. Binary Classification: refers to those classification tasks that have two class labels.\noindent \\
2. Multi class Classification: refers to those classification tasks that have more than two class labels.\noindent \\
Classifiers could be divided in : \noindent \\
1. Linear Classifiers (i.e. Logistic Regression,LDA,SVM) \noindent \\
2. Non Linear Classifiers (i.e. KNN,Decision Tree) \noindent \\

Linear Classifiers are adopted when the classes are  linearly-separable,while when we can't draw one straight line in order to separate the classes, we have to use a Non-Linear Classifier.
