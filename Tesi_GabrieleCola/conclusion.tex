\chapter{Conclusion}

In churn analysis, you can notice through the graph that the highest accuracy is obtained when the classifier is combined with OSS method, while Adasyn resulted as the worst method. Furthermore, it can be affirmed that  under-sampling methods work better than oversampling and hybrid methods in this dataset.\\
While in spam detection case, you can spot through the graph that the classifier which has the highest accuracy is smote-boosting, while cost-sensitive decision tree resulted as the worst method. Furthermore, it cannot be affirmed that a kind of cost-sensitive method works better than others because every method has completely different accuracy even if they belong to the same type.\\
Finally, the accuracy of cost-sensitive methods is slightly higher than data-level methods.
