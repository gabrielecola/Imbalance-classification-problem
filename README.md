# The Imbalance problem in Classification

Final dissertation for the BSc in Statistics at Università degli Studi di Napoli Federico II.

### Abstract

The document proposes several approaches to deal with Class Imbalance. Firstly it analyze the pros and cons of the Pre-processing methods, that  they can be divided in: \
• Undersampling methods \
• Oversampling methods \
• Hybrid methods 

Secondly it analyze the Cost sensitive solutions, that are characterized by modifying existing algorithm (i.e Decision Tree, SVM, Ensemble Methods) \
Finally there is an application of all these methods to two dataset. The first dataset is about Churn and they are adopted all the pre-processing methods,
while the second one is about Spam and instead they are adopted all cost sensitive methods.
